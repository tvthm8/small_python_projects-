# Small Python Projects
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository for small Python projects I'm working on. This is my space to experiment, learn, and have fun while building simple yet engaging programs. I'm constantly adding new ideas here, so feel free to check back often!

## Project Highlight: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- One of the projects in this repository is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It's a classic game where you play against the computer. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

You can choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly makes its own choice.
The game then decides the winner based on the traditional rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both you and the computer make the same choice, it's a tie!
I had fun building this as it helped me practice working with Python's random module, user input, and conditional logic. It's a small project, but it's a great way to learn the basics of Python programming!

## Part 2
Now it's a best-of-three match! You and the computer compete until one of you wins 2 rounds.
The game keeps track of the score for both the player and the computer.
Once someone reaches 2 wins, the overall winner is announced with a congratulatory message.
This update added more logic to the code, and I had a lot of fun implementing a scoring system. It was a great way to dive deeper into loops and conditionals in Python.

 ## Food Order System (Part 1)
I recently started working on a Food Order System, and this is just the beginning (Part 1 of 2)! It's a simple program that simulates an ordering process for Italian meals. Here's what it does so far:

## Part 1:
Displays a menu of Italian dishes, including classics like Pasta Bolognese, Pepperoni Pizza, Margherita Pizza, and Lasagna.
Allows the user to choose a meal from the menu.
Prompts the user to specify how much of the chosen meal they'd like.
Provides a summary of the order (or notifies the user if the meal isn't available).
This project gave me a chance to practice working with functions, input handling, and list-based menus in Python. Itâ€™s a foundational step as I gear up for Part 2, where I plan to add more interactivity and functionality.

## This quick project was all about testing out a new IDE: Visual Studio Code. I created a simple Band Name Generator, 
- which takes the name of your city and a pet, combines them, and gives you a fun band name (e.g., "Statesboro Ace").

The process was straightforward, and after trying it out, Iâ€™ve decided VS Code will be my go-to IDE for projects moving forward!

Project Highlight: Food Order System (Part 2)
This is Part 2 of my Food Order System project, and Iâ€™ve taken things up a notch! The system now supports multiple cuisines, adding more variety and flexibility to the ordering process. Here's what I added in this second installment:

## New Features in Part 2:
Multi-Cuisine Support: You can now choose between Italian and Indian meals. The Indian menu includes dishes like Curry, Chutney, Samosa, and Naan.
Dynamic Menu Display: Depending on the selected cuisine, the program displays the appropriate menu for the user.
Input Validation: The system now checks for valid food types and meals, ensuring a smoother user experience.
Improved Order Summary: It still gives you a personalized confirmation, but now it works seamlessly across multiple menus.
This update was all about expanding functionality while keeping the interface simple and intuitive. Part 2 wraps up this project by adding versatility, but who knowsâ€”I might revisit it in the future for even more features, like pricing, payment, or delivery options!
