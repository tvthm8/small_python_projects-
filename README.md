# Small Python Projects
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository for small Python projects I'm working on. This is my space to experiment, learn, and have fun while building simple yet engaging programs. I'm constantly adding new ideas here, so feel free to check back often!

## Project Highlight: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- One of the projects in this repository is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It's a classic game where you play against the computer. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

You can choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly makes its own choice.
The game then decides the winner based on the traditional rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both you and the computer make the same choice, it's a tie!
I had fun building this as it helped me practice working with Python's random module, user input, and conditional logic. It's a small project, but it's a great way to learn the basics of Python programming!
